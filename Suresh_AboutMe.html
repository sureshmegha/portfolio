        I am a persistent freshman at Dublin High School, striving to become a software engineer. I have chosen this path because I am inspired by the way technology is shaping the world I live in and igniting social change, and I want to take part of our future.  I wish to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, or Stanford University for around six to seven years. I will apply to the Computer Science Academy in order to grow in the field of computer science. I will earn my Masterâ€™s Degree in the field of technology and find myself a successful career.

        Despite of my age, I am currently taking precalculus as the only freshman in my class. I did not let my age get in the way of my learning and I am ambitious to fulfill my learning and academic capacities. I wake up early every day to be a leader in my orchestra class. I direct my classmates as a role model, setting myself as an example towards them. I am also part of an after-school Robotics club where we design and create robots that perform functions for competitions. During these sessions, I participate to keep our group organized and to creatively come up with efficient ways to make our robots work. I am open-minded to the ideas of my teammates, and cooperate with them to build the best possible robot.

        Although I am only a freshman, I recently applied and have been accepted for a job at Kumon as a work-grader (learn more <a href="Kumon.html">here</a>). I work hard and efficiently six hours a week, earning around minimum age. I make sure I am as organized as I can be, and I interact with care and understanding to the students that ask me questions. On Sundays, I have violin class, where I work in small chamber groups to perform amazing music. My teacher and I communicate in order to improve my skills as a violinist. I also have been participating in the United States Badminton Academy for almost two years with compassion. Every weekend, I work on becoming the best athlete I can. 
        </br> </br>
        Overall, I am an authoritative and responsible 9th grader on the path to becoming a software engineer. Thank you for your time to understand a small aspect of my life, and I advise you to explore the rest of my site.
