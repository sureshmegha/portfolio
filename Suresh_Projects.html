        <strong> Project: </strong> Scratch Story </br>
        <strong> Course: </strong> Computer Science Principles </br>
        <strong> Duration: </strong> Around 8 days </br>
        <strong> Objective: </strong> Develop a story or game on Scratch, with an objective and many alternatives. There should be many states in order for the user to experience variety. </br>
        <strong> Type of Project: </strong> Group Project </br> </br>
        For the Scratch project, my partner and I brainstormed many alternatives to a story that would interest the viewers. We finally ended up with the idea of a Finding Nemo copy, where we replicated the parts of the movie, but allowed our viewers to decide the next moves. We incorporated many sections throughout the movie through coding. The idea contained many fun interactive characters aspects of humour, and a clear problem in the storyline. The goal of the game was to help Nemoâ€™s father find his son, with many obstacles in each path. We received many positive feedback, including how interactive and creative the game was. Our team dynamic was great; we communicated consistently, which was one of the main components of our success. To access the game, scroll below! </br> </br>

        HELP! Nemo was stolen by a scuba diver! Dory and Marlin are taking you with them on an adventure to find Nemo. During the story, you will have different buttons for options on how you want the story to go. Remember, choose wisely! The wrong choice could end up with a few dead fish... Good luck!
